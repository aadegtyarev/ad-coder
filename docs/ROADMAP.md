# ad-coder roadmap & design decisions

Forward-looking companion to ARCHITECTURE.md (which describes current state).
Captures decided-but-unbuilt features so nothing is lost to a dropped session.
Rationale for the cost/economics claims lives in `docs/cost-economics.md`;
verified pi internals in `docs/pi-capabilities.md`.

## Guiding principle: gates over prompts

A prompt instruction ("keep files small", "don't leak secrets", "match the
style") is a soft constraint that competes with the task for the model's
attention and loses. Every quality/safety property in ad-coder is therefore a
**mechanical gate the model cannot talk past**, not an instruction: a hard
budget, a deterministic check, a structural invariant. The model may ignore the
intent all it wants — the gate fires afterward and returns the failure as the
next turn's input. This is why the industry replaced style guides with
formatters, and it is the through-line of every decision below.

## Module parallelism principle

Verified from the code: modules are disjoint (one type-only cross-import,
`preflight → role`), and the only shared seam is the barrel (`src/index.ts`,
append-only export lines) + docs + `package.json`/`bun.lock` when deps change.
So: **a module is the unit of parallelism; the integration seam is thin and
serial.** Fan out on the leaves (write+test the module — the expensive 90%),
serialize the integration (wire the barrel + docs — trivial, append-only). A
change that touches only its own dir + the thin seam is a safe parallel
candidate; one that reaches into `role.ts` and `ledger.ts` at once is not.
Design to keep the seam thin (subpath exports / a generated barrel would remove
`index.ts` from the seam entirely). ad-coder should eventually detect
module-locality from the touched-file set to decide what can parallelize.

## Status

- **Phase 0** — DONE (`55f32ff`). Role preset over AgentHarnessOptions; Ledger
  of per-turn usage attributed by role/step/run, cost from Usage.cost never
  recomputed, records carry identifiers+numbers only.
- **Ledger fix** — DONE (`90bdf67`). after_response usage is per-response, not
  cumulative (proven by revert-fails-tests). diffUsage/UsageDeltaTracker kept
  for the genuinely-cumulative message_update source.
- **Phase 1** — DONE (`9976aaf`). In-house context management: ContextBudget on
  Role validated against a CALLER-SUPPLIED Model (local/LM-Studio safe),
  ContextCompactor via transform_context with ad-coder's own prompt,
  assertTurnFitsBudget pre-flight (a function, not a hook — a hook throw cannot
  refuse a turn). Pi compaction stays disabled.
- **Capability matrix** — DONE. `src/capabilities/capabilities.ts`:
  `deriveCapabilities(model)` yields a ModelCapabilities descriptor — cost mode
  (per-token when any cost field is nonzero; else local when the baseUrl host is
  loopback/private or the provider matches /lmstudio|vllm|local/i; else
  prepaid), `cacheControllable`, context window, cache read/write unit costs,
  out/in ratio. The corrected controllability predicate is `model.api ===
  "anthropic-messages" || model.compat.cacheControlFormat === "anthropic"` — NOT
  the format alone, which is a false negative on native Anthropic. Two pure
  metrics: `cacheEfficiency = cacheRead / (cacheRead + input)`; `breakEvenReads`
  (fable-5 = 1.4, `"always"` when cacheWrite is 0, `"degenerate"` when input <=
  cacheRead). `reconcileRoleWithModel` WARNS (never throws) when a role's
  cacheRetention is inert on its model. The empirical declared-vs-observed layer
  from the first live response is deferred.

- **Quality gates** — DONE (`b94b8e9`). `src/gates/`: a QualityGate declared as
  config { name, kind: format|lint|typecheck|size, command, autofix?,
  maxLinesPerFile? }; a GateRunner with an injected CommandExecutor seam
  (testable with a fake, no shelling out), autofix-first-then-check, in-process
  size gate, bounded fail-loud GateReport, argv-only (no shell string). Not yet
  wired into ad-coder's own build — a deliberate follow-up.

## After that (designed, ordered)

- **End-to-end runner — the missing glue, TOP priority.** ad-coder has the
  building blocks (Role→AgentHarnessOptions, Ledger.attach, Compactor.attach) but
  nothing that takes a Role and DRIVES a turn: no `createAgentHarness(options,
  context)` wiring, no Session/Models/Context construction, no driver. So the
  harness cannot be run live end to end — only the pi-ai layer below and the pure
  functions above are testable. Live-verified 2026-09-11 that the foundation is
  sound (real DeepSeek call: Usage.cost populated, usage per-response, matrix +
  ledger agree with reality) — the gap is purely the glue. Contract to settle in
  planOnly: (1) the runner takes a TARGET working directory distinct from the
  harness's own cwd — the agent's bash/edit/read tools and the ledger operate in
  the target (a clean test folder or a real project), NOT "wherever ad-coder was
  launched"; harness-dir ≠ target-dir from day one. (2) Credentials come from an
  explicit source (the harness's env), never picked up from the target project's
  .env. (3) WorkflowContext gains a way to run a role (run(ctx) currently gets
  only {runId, ledger}). (4) Testable with pi-ai's fauxProvider — zero network in
  the suite; the live path is opt-in with a real key.
- **Wire ad-coder's own gates** — the gates module exists but ad-coder still runs
  only typecheck+test on itself. Add a size gate + (when a formatter/linter is
  chosen) format/lint gates over the repo. Dogfooding the gates-over-prompts
  principle. Small.
- **Doc taxonomy** — organize docs by enforcement role, not genre: contract
  (addressable by trigger, injected into the role that touches its area) /
  decision record (immutable) / work item (backlog) / orientation (README) /
  executable process (a gate/test, never prose). Most "docs" should be a
  contract-with-a-trigger, an immutable decision, or — if enforceable — a gate,
  not freeform prose. Trust perimeters are contracts. ad-coder ships this as an
  opinionated default so users don't reinvent docs/ chaos.
- **Auditor role + refactor executor** — recognizing decomposition needs vs doing
  them safely, two tools. Auditor: a cold-read role triggered by a drift signal
  (size band, churn, drift-log-reaches-8) that surfaces decomposition candidates
  WITH EVIDENCE into the backlog, never acts. The size gate is the crude floor;
  the auditor is the judgment layer. Refactor executor: test-pinned —
  characterization tests first, refactor under green in small behavior-preserving
  steps, "did a test have to change?" is a visible justified event (extends the
  revert-and-restore proof), and LSP/AST moves (rename/extract, safe by
  construction) preferred over LLM regeneration. Large decompositions reshape the
  shared barrel/multiple modules, so they are NOT parallel-safe.

- **Profiles** — on top of the matrix. A profile is intent → matrix → model:
  `{ tier, maxOutput, cacheRetention }` per role, named intent (`cheap`/`max`)
  not a hard id, so it ports across providers. Ledger's per-lane attribution
  lets one workflow run under two profiles and compare two JSONL files. Profiles
  come AFTER the matrix because they make decisions the matrix must justify.
- **Project memory** — committed, machine-portable (laptop↔desktop via git).
  Decided: autonomy default `push` (agent commits+pushes), commits on the
  working branch (one `git pull` brings code+memory atomically). Non-negotiable
  structural invariants regardless of autonomy: secret-scan before write (built
  INTO ad-coder, not a dependency on an external scanner that may be absent on a
  given machine; gitleaks as optional augment), commit ONLY the memory namespace
  (never `git add -A`), per-file layout so cross-machine merges never conflict,
  never force-push. Block-and-shout on a detected secret, never auto-redact
  (a miss gives false confidence; a mangle corrupts memory). Live resume across
  machines is impossible (resumeFromRunId cache is in-process) — a checkpoint
  replaces it with an informed restart.
- **Parallel runs** — worktree-isolated independent features, Ledger already
  carries the `lane` dimension for per-lane cost attribution. Combines with
  profiles (different model per lane). Bounded by the module-parallelism
  principle: only file-disjoint work parallelizes cleanly.

## Open backlog (mechanical)

See docs/BACKLOG.md. Notably: ContextBudgetError should surface the effective
ceiling min(maxTokens, contextWindow) (minor); UsageDeltaTracker Map growth;
ledger JSONL retention policy.
